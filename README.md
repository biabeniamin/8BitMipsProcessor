## 8 Bit Mips processor

Welcome to the 8 Bit Mips processor wiki!

This repository is work in progress and the purpose of this is develop a simple CPU in Vhdl.
The project has three versions: <br />
* Singe cycle where all operations are executed in a sungle instruction cycle
* Multi cycle where all operations are executed in multiple instruction cycles
* Pipeline where some operations are executed in a single operations cycle and some in multiple cycles. It is also protected against data hazard.

Supported instruction formats are:
* R type
* I type
* J type

## Motivation

This project was develop in order to understand computer architecture better.

## Installing

Generate bitstream file Vivado 2017.7<br />
* Upload it on a Digilent Basys 3 board
